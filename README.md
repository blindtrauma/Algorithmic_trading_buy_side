Overview
This repository contains a Python-based trading algorithm designed for trading financial assets in various markets such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, or commodities. The algorithm aims to automate trading decisions based on predefined conditions, technical indicators, and risk management rules.

Features
Data Integration: Utilizes the Yahoo Finance API to obtain historical and real-time market data for analysis.

EMA Calculation: Calculates Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) with customizable periods (14, 21, and 34) to identify trends in price data.

ADX Calculation: Computes the Average Directional Index (ADX) to measure the strength of price trends.

Customizable Strategies: Users can define and customize trading strategies by specifying conditions and technical indicators.

Real-time Execution: Capable of executing trades in real-time through broker APIs or simulated trading environments.

Getting Started
Installation: Make sure to install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Configuration: Set up your API keys and configure trading parameters in the script.

Usage: Run the Python script and follow the prompts to input the ticker symbol and execute the algorithm.

Usage
To use this trading algorithm:

Run the script and provide the ticker symbol for the asset you want to trade.

The algorithm will fetch historical and real-time data.

It calculates EMAs (14, 21, 34), ADX, and applies customizable trading conditions.

When the conditions are met, the algorithm may trigger a trade (customize this part for your broker's API).

Trades can be logged or executed in real-time based on your configuration.
